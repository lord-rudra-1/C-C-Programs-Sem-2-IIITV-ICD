## Lab Sessions :

### 1. Student Linked List Program :
This C program manages a list of students using a singly linked list. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding new student records, displaying all student records, deleting a student record by roll number, searching for a student by roll number, and inserting a new student at a specified position. The program demonstrates fundamental linked list operations and provides a basic interface for interacting with the student data. Each student record consists of a roll number, name, and a pointer to the next student, forming a chain of records that can be traversed and modified as needed.

### 2. Double-Ended Queue (Deque) Implementation in C : 
This C program implements a double-ended queue (deque) using a circular array. The deque allows for insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and back ends of the queue. The program includes functions to check if the deque is empty or full, to push and pop elements from both ends, and to retrieve the front and back elements. Additionally, it can display the current size and contents of the deque.

### 3. a)Polynomial Operations Using Linked Lists in C :
This C program implements polynomial addition and subtraction using singly linked lists. Each polynomial is represented as a linked list, where each node contains a coefficient and an exponent. The program provides functions to display, add, and subtract polynomials.
### 3. b)Polynomial Operations Using Linked Lists in C with Auxiliary Memory Management :
This C program implements polynomial addition using singly linked lists. Each polynomial is represented as a linked list, where each node contains a coefficient and an exponent. The program includes functions to display polynomials, add two polynomials, and manage auxiliary memory for efficient memory usage.

### 4.Stack Implementation Using Two Queues in C :
This C program implements a stack using two queues. It demonstrates fundamental stack operations such as push and pop while using queues to store and manage the elements. The program utilizes two arrays to represent the queues and provides various utility functions to manage and display the stack contents.

### 5. QuickSort Algorithm in C :
This C program implements the QuickSort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of integers. The program sorts an array of ten integers and displays the array before and after sorting.

### 6. Heap Sort Algorithm in C : 
This C program implements the Heap Sort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort an array of integers. The program sorts an array of ten integers and displays the array before and after sorting.

### 7. Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation :
This C program converts an infix expression to postfix and then evaluates the postfix expression to produce the result. It utilizes a stack-based approach to convert infix to postfix and evaluates the postfix expression.

### 8. Infix Expression Evaluation with Balanced Parentheses Check :
This C program efficiently evaluates infix expressions while ensuring that the input expressions have balanced parentheses. It converts the infix expression into postfix notation, handling operators and maintaining the correct order of operations. After conversion, it evaluates the postfix expression, performing arithmetic and logical operations as needed. If the input expression contains unbalanced parentheses, the program promptly notifies the user, ensuring the integrity of the evaluation process. This program provides a robust solution for evaluating infix expressions, making it suitable for various mathematical and computational tasks.

### 9. Binary Search Tree Operations in C :
This C program demonstrates various operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST), including insertion and deletion. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding and removing nodes from the tree while maintaining the binary search tree property. The program prompts the user to input values to add to the BST and then displays the resulting tree structure using an in-order traversal. Additionally, it allows users to delete specific nodes from the BST by entering the value to be deleted, providing feedback on the success or failure of the deletion operation. Throughout the program, careful attention is paid to maintaining the integrity of the BST structure and handling edge cases, ensuring the correct functioning of the operations.
