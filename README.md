# C/C++ Programs-Sem-2-IIITV-ICD
Welcome to the repository containing C/C++ programs for the second semester at IIITV-ICD. This repository includes code from various sources such as lab sessions, assignments, tutorials, and class discussions.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:
<br>
1. Lab Sessions: Contains programs written during lab sessions.
2. Assignments: Includes the code for assignments given throughout the semester.
3. Tutorials: Features tutorial examples and practice problems.
4. Other
## Lab Sessions : 
1. This C program manages a list of students using a singly linked list. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding new student records, displaying all student records, deleting a student record by roll number, searching for a student by roll number, and inserting a new student at a specified position. The program demonstrates fundamental linked list operations and provides a basic interface for interacting with the student data. Each student record consists of a roll number, name, and a pointer to the next student, forming a chain of records that can be traversed and modified as needed.
2. This C program implements a double-ended queue (deque) using a circular array. The deque allows for insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and back ends of the queue. The program includes functions to check if the deque is empty or full, to push and pop elements from both ends, and to retrieve the front and back elements. Additionally, it can display the current size and contents of the deque.
3. a)This C program implements polynomial addition and subtraction using singly linked lists. Each polynomial is represented as a linked list, where each node contains a coefficient and an exponent. The program provides functions to display, add, and subtract polynomials.
<br> b)This C program implements polynomial addition using singly linked lists. Each polynomial is represented as a linked list, where each node contains a coefficient and an exponent. The program includes functions to display polynomials, add two polynomials, and manage auxiliary memory for efficient memory usage.
4. This C program implements a stack using two queues. It demonstrates fundamental stack operations such as push and pop while using queues to store and manage the elements. The program utilizes two arrays to represent the queues and provides various utility functions to manage and display the stack contents.
